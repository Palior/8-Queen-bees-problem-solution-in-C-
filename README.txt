This code implements a solution for the 8 queens problem, which involves placing 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard so that no queen can attack another. This means they cannot share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Detailed Code Description:

createBoard: Creates an 8x8 board filled with zeros (0) and places a 1 in positions given by a set of coordinates (rows and columns) representing the queens' positions.

addSolution: Given a list of solutions (each solution is a board), it adds a new solution to the list. This is done by allocating more space for the new solution and copying the previous solutions to a new list with more capacity.

removeSolution: Removes a solution from the solutions list, excluding the solution at the specified position. It creates a new list without the removed solution and releases the memory of the previous list.

print: Prints an 8x8 board to the console, showing the 1s (representing the queens) and the 0s.

printSolutions: Prints all stored solutions (boards) in the solutions list.

checkHorizontal, checkVertical, and checkDiagonal: These functions check if there is more than one queen in the same row, column, or diagonal, respectively. They return 1 if the rule is met (no conflicts) and 0 if there are conflicts.

Program Flow in main:

	Variables are initialized to store the queens' positions, and the necessary structures are created to store the boards.
	All possible combinations of positions for the 8 queens on the board are generated. For each combination, a board is created and added to the solutions list.
	Solutions are printed.
	Solutions are filtered, removing those that do not meet the restrictions:
	First, solutions with more than one queen in the same row are removed (horizontal check).
	Next, solutions with more than one queen in the same column are removed (vertical check).
	Finally, solutions with more than one queen in the same diagonal are removed (diagonal check).
	The solutions that meet all the 8 queens problem restrictions are printed.

Summary: The code seeks all possible arrangements of 8 queens on a board and then filters out those that do not meet the row, column, or diagonal restrictions, displaying only the valid solutions.
